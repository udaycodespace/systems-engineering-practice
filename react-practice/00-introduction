React — Introduction

React:
JS library to build dynamic, component-based user interfaces.

Why React?
Keeps UI and data in sync automatically.

React > HTML + CSS + JS because:

No manual DOM updates

Reusable components

Better for large & complex UIs

Faster UI updates (efficient rendering)

Cleaner and maintainable code

When to learn React:
After strong basics of JavaScript + DOM + browser behavior.

Why React was created:
To fix UI inconsistency when data changes but UI doesn’t update properly.

Core React Concepts:

Component → reusable UI block

JSX → HTML inside JavaScript

State → data that changes UI

Props → data passed to components

Hooks → manage state & logic (useState, useEffect)

Learning approach:
Project-based, code-along practice.

Real-world uses:
Dashboards, e-commerce, social apps, admin panels, large web apps.

Next after React:
Backend or frameworks like Next.js.
